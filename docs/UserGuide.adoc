== Introduction

_Acquizition_ is a *desktop app* for easy language acquisition
and memory retention. By using a Spaced Repetition System (SRS),
_Acquizition_ cleverly determines which flashcards should be
tested to maximize recollection.

Additionally, _Acquizition_ provides a user-friendly Graphical
User Interface (GUI) to create and edit flashcards. It also
provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to streamline the
experience for more experienced users.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
